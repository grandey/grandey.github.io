## About
My science research interests include global climate modeling and climate processes, particularly the climate impacts of aerosols â€” particles suspended in the atmosphere. Aerosols scatter and absorb sunlight; and they provide the cloud condensation nuclei on which cloud droplets form. Aerosols and clouds are responsible for some of the largest uncertainties in projections of future climate.

I completed my DPhil (PhD) in Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics, working as part of the Climate Processes group at the University of Oxford. From 2012 to 2018, I worked at the Center for Environmental Sensing and Modeling (CENSAM), part of the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART). As of April 2019, I am still a Research Affiliate with SMART-CENSAM, although I have been transitioning to a career break in order to spend more time pursuing other interests.
